# Code of Conduct

Science is hard, and the work of making sure science isn't harder than it needs to be is on all of us. We create our culture, and in the Goldsmiths nfantlab our culture is inclusive.

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure an that every lab member and collaborator has a positive, educational experience unhindered by unneccesary challenges caused by non-inclusive behavior. Accordingly, everyone who participates in any InfantLab project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times.

Caspar Addyman, as head of the InfantLab, and all lab members, are dedicated to a ***harassment and discrimination-free experience for everyone.*** Discrimination or harassment based on racial or ethnic background, citizenship status, religion (or lack thereof), political affiliation, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, dis/ability status, appearance or body size will not be tolerated.  **We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination by and/or of members of our community in any form**. 

We are particularly motivated to support new and/or anxious collaborators, people who are looking to learn and develop their skills, and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past. 

To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

* All communication - online and in person - should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual or discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.

* Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other contributers.

* Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

* Please make an effort to make an inclusive environment for everyone. Give everyone a chance to talk and an opportunity to contribute.

* Watch out for [microaggressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression). Be aware that your actions can be hurtful to others or contribute to a negative environment even if you had no intent of harm. Listen. Offer a genuine apology. Commit to learning and doing better.

* A SPECIAL NOTE: Your work in this lab will be publicly available and recorded permanently on github. Please conduct yourself accordingly.

Unacceptable behavior includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

***Participants asked to stop any harassing or discriminatory behavior are expected to comply immediately.***

Members of the community who violate these rules - no matter how much they have contributed to the InfantLab, or how specialised their skill set - will be approached by Caspar Addyman. If inappropriate behaviour persists after a discussion with Caspar, the issue will be escalated according to procedures laid out by the relevant parts of Goldsmiths policies on [harassment and misconduct](https://www.gold.ac.uk/governance/policies/sexual-violence-harassment-misconduct-policy/)

**To report an issue** please contact [Caspar Addyman](https://github.com/YourBrain). All communication will be treated as confidential.

### Working with parents and children

The InfantLab depends on parent and young children volunteering their time to take part in our studies. We value and recognise their contribution and will make every effort to ensure that they understand the purpose of our research and their role in it. 
Anonymity and the right to withdraw from participation will always be respected .Information will be held securely and in confidence. This means we will only tell those who have a need or right to know. 

We follow the Goldsmiths [Safeguarding Policy](https://www.gold.ac.uk/governance/policies/safeguarding-policy/).

***All lab members working unsupervised with families will have up-to-date DBM checks.***  


### Professional standards

We support and comply with the American Psychological Associations [Ethical Principles of psychologists and code of conduct](https://www.apa.org/ethics/code/principles.pdf)
We support and comply with all the stated [policies of Goldsmiths, University of London](https://www.gold.ac.uk/governance/policies/). 
In particular, have reviewed all our lab practices to comply with Europe's new General Data Protection Regulations [GDPR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr)

### Flexible working hours

This sentence is stolen from [Bastian Greshake's](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke) email footer and forms the basis of our policy on flexible working:

> While I may be sending this email outside my normal office hours, I have no expectation to receive a reply outside yours.

The hours that members of the lab choose to work is up to them. We are each welcome to send work-related emails or pull requests over the weekend or late at night, but no lab members are required to reply to them outside of their typical work hours.

Lab members are welcome to work flexibly for any reason. All lab members will have at least a few hours each week of designated interaction time with Christie in order to stay in touch on any challenges or successes, but it is the policy of the Bahlai Lab that every member is already self-motivated and may choose to deviate from a traditional 9 to 5 day in order to meet our collective goals.

**If you experience any challenges related to flexible working within the lab** please contact [Caspar Addyman](https://github.com/yourbrain). All communication will be treated as confidential.
