# Policies

This repo contains a collection of policies, standard procedures and guidelines we adhere to in the Goldsmiths [InfantLab](http://sites.gold.ac.uk/infantlab). These documents are intended to help lab members get aquainted with the culture of the lab, and to help collaborators and colleagues see how we do things.

The two important documents are 
* [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/InfantLab/Policies/blob/master/Code_of_conduct.md)
* [General Guidelines](https://github.com/InfantLab/Policies/blob/master/General_Guidelines.md) - note this is still being adapted.

Other guides you will find here eventually, 
* [Consulting and meetings policy](https://github.com/InfantLab/Policies/blob/master/Consulting.md)

Thank you,
